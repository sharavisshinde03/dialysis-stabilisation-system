# AI-Based Dialysis Stabilisation System

This module implements an AI-based digital twin simulation of a dialysis machine.
It focuses on vibration detection, adaptive stabilisation logic, and emergency alerting.

The system is designed to work with minimal hardware (accelerometer + microcontroller),
while enabling complete validation using AI-generated vibration simulations.
