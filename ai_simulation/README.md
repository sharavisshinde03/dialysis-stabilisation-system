# AI-Based Dialysis Stabilisation Simulation

This module implements an AI-based digital twin simulation of a dialysis machine.
It simulates vibration detection, adaptive stabilisation logic, and emergency alerting.

The system is designed to work with minimal hardware (accelerometer + microcontroller),
while allowing full validation through AI-generated vibration simulations.
