# AI-Based Dialysis Stabilisation System

A real-time dialysis monitoring and stabilisation system designed to enhance patient safety during seismic and vibration events.

## 🧠 System Overview
This project simulates a dialysis machine that:
- Monitors vibration levels
- Adjusts blood flow and pressures automatically
- Switches to stabilisation or emergency stop mode
- Displays real-time data on a Flutter Web dashboard

## 🏗 Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web
- **Simulation**: Python-based vibration & dialysis logic
- **Communication**: REST APIs (JSON)
